# DIY-Mic
A DIY microphone built using the design of DIY Perks and modified by me. I wanted a decent mic and I didnt want to spend the money on one, so when I saw this video it seemed like the perfect opportunity for me to both have fun with a electronics project and get a decent mic.

This would not be possible without DIY Perks and the resources he provided. The stripboard and base wiring diagram are extremely helpful as well as his overall attention to detail. Video link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=LoQu3XXIayc

# Aquiring Parts
For this build, there are a number of parts you will need. In the video he goes all out in brass, which for most of us at home, seems absurd because of how uncommon it is to have the exact diameter of brass tubing or brass mesh lying around. I ran into this problem early on, so I designed a box and lid for mine that should work in place of a ton of brass and wood, and is easily 3d printable (STLs above). I know most people don't have 3d printers but I feel like this is slightly more accessable for those without hordes of tools. I also used a mic arm I found in the trash to make the arm instead of building it. So, with the 'housing' out of the way, everything else can be found in this list (or at least what I used/needed):

As you can probably tell, the pricing is pretty high compared to the sticker price. That was the number I was able to get it down to after some alternatives (and using the wrong materials and finding out they dont work. The electronics can either be found on alibaba or ebay, I chose ebay because that was the only way I could finish this in less then 2 months. With all of that, I nicked a old audio cable, a old rc car motor, and some resistors in order to start buuilding.

# Actually Building the Thing
The first thing I did (and this pretty much goes with the order the parts arrived to me) was the preamp box. I put some brass mesh on the bottom and glued the template on some protoboard, soldered all of the parts on and drilled corner holes. In hindsight, the pegs I included were pretty useless (and off center) so they should probably just be removed. I layered some tape over the bottom mesh to preevent shorts and plopped the whoile thin in. I then added the potentiometer to the lid. Note, I live in the US, so I was unable to get a THAT1512, and I had to go with a INA217. This isn't really a problem, just know that on my final build, I attached a 2.2kOhm reesistor to the potentiometer because of how the gain settings work. I pretty much did that and threw in the ADC
